### Get Started
This repository contains the code for our PAKDD'22 paper, *Contrastive Attributed Network Anomaly Detection with Data Augmentation*, as well as three other GNN baselines used as comparison.
The evaluation data are included in the data/ folder. To run these models, use the [main.py](main.py) script and corresponding training function in it.
